## Commenting on/Offering Feedback on a Lesson for PierceHacker

As we complete our initial drafts of lessons/tutorials, a next step will be to write up reviews of each other's work.

Ideally, you will be able to actually attempt to execute the lesson the author has written and ground our reviews in the actual process of using the lesson. As a reviewer, then, your first task is to actually try to complete lesson.

Something to keep in mind. The commentary you offer should seek not to "fix" the writers work but attempt to offer them some guidance on where the lesson is working and how the lesson might better help its audience learn the skill, technique, or tool that lesson focuses on. Ultimetaely we want these tutorials to be useful resources to members of the Pierce Community.

Writing a good tutorial is every bit as demanding, if not more so, than any other kind of academic writing. Below are a few common questions to keep in mind as you review a lesson. Some will be more relevant than others, depending on the topic, intended audience, and the difficulty of the tutorial. Needless to say, this is neither a restrictive or comprehensive list, but a guide to the kind of commentary that I hope will allow writers to make their lessons publishable.
Using the questions/categories below, write-up a review of your peers’ lesson for PierceHacker. 

## Audience
I hope that the PierceHacker project will speak to a variety of audiences and reader skill levels. Some lessons are for complete beginners, while others are for those considerably more comfortable with technical concepts and methods.

While it is a good thing that each of our lessons to take the unique voice of its author, we also want each individual lesson to remain clear and consistent in its tone. More specifically, we want the technical explanations (and difficulty) to remain as constant as possible throughout the lesson. For exemple, as a reviewer, it will be useful to note any sections of a tutorial directed at more technically advanced users that might over-explain relatively simple concepts. The opposite is also true. We want to avoid sections of tutorials aimed at beginners that don’t adequately explain fundamental concepts central to the tutorial. 

Some questions to keep in mind:

* Does the author address a consistent model reader throughout the lesson? Has the author made clear who the potential audience for this lesson is and why?
* Are some concepts or steps over-explained while other are under-explained?
* Does the audience seem to match at least generally with the population of the Pierce College community?

## Getting Ready

What are the initial things the audience will need in order to complete this lesson? Has the author of the lesson made these things clear? 

For example:

* What software / programming languages are required?
* What prerequisite skills are needed?
* What familiarity or experience is needed?
* What data are needed? Is the dataset readily available? For example, if the user needs sample equations to to complete the tutorial are these made available?

If you are unable to clearly answer these questions, what might the writer of the lesson do to make these things more clear to their audience?

## Skimmability
Instructional documents often need to be skimmed or accessed quickly for information. Often the audience might need a refresher for a project they are working on, or they simply what to quickly get the gist of things before they jump into the line by line details.

Consider:

* Are there clearly defined learning objectives or sets of skills to be learned listed near the top of the lesson?
* Are there useful secondary skills to be gained / practiced from the lesson?
* Do screenshots and other diagrams illustrate crucial steps / points of the lesson?
* Do sections and section headings provide clear signage to the reader? Are sections headings navigatable as links/anchors in the text.

If your answer to any of these questions is no -- what could the writer of the lesson do to provide these elements to their audience?

## Payoff
All writing, of course, usually has some kind of payoff for the reader, but one of the great things about technical writing is that its a field of communication concerned with creating texts that are useful. 

*Context is key.* Many of our users will have very pragmatic needs. For example,  they need to be able to use Word or Google Docs to format a paper. But even these seemingly straightforward needs often sync up to a larger context -- what is MLA or APA format and why is it valued in the context of a particular course or field of study? So while we want PierceHacker to strive for clarity and usefulness, we also want to help users understand the why’s that opreate hand-in-hand with the how’s. PierceHacker is after a critical, robust information competency. A critical information competency will not only illustrate how to do something, but will offer a user insight into why a particular skill or technique might be valuable or necessary.

Consider:

* Does the tutorial suggest why the explained tools or techniques are useful? Is this use linked to a particular situation? 
* Does the skiil/knowledge have more general uses, perhaps even beyond the more specfic ones? Has the author made this clear?
* Does the tutorial suggest how a reader could apply the concepts (if not concrete steps) of the lesson to their own work? Has the author made this clear?

If your answer to any of these questions is no -- what could the writer of the lesson do to provide these elements to their audience?

## Workflow

Consider:

* Should a long lesson be divided into smaller lessons?
* Are there logical stopping points throughout the lesson?
* If raw materials are required to execute the lesson (datasets, images, sound files, etc.), are they available to use, download or otherwise access at various points throughout the lesson?

Again, If your answer to any of these questions is no -- what suggestions do you have for the writer to improve the lesson's workflow for thier audience?

## Further reading/additional resources

Single tutorials cannot be expected to cover everthing. For example, a more advanced tutorial might need the user to be at least somewhat familiar with a concept or tool in order to be useful. Additionally, multiple tutorials often exist on the same general topic. 

Consider:

* In the tutorial has the author made clear when prior knowledge by the user will be useful because they are not going to cover a basic element of tool/technique/etc.? In this refence has the author linked/referred the user to additional resource that they can use to get this requisite skill?
* Has the author referred the user to additional resources that might also be of use in developing the skill, etc.?
